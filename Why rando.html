        <h1>Why randomize?</h1>

        <p>
          If you're unfamiliar with speedrun communities, chances are this very
          website could be puzzling to you. Why would people want to scatter all
          items, and tediously explore the entire world just to end up finding
          them in places that make no sense?
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, many randomizers never make sense. Anything can be anywhere,
          and there's no way of knowing where to look or what approach to take.
          However, in a strange sense, that's exactly the appeal of rando!
        </p>
        <p>
          Every single playthrough will be different. The players hand will
          always be different! It can screw you over in a million ways, but it
          also creates many whacky scenarios. If you find flute early, for
          example, that creates a logical way up Death Mountain, and thus, it
          points you in a direction! If you find an early master sword, that
          means Aghanim is in logic. Better check the lumberjack ledge, because
          if it's hammer, it means he's required!
        </p>
        <p class="bottom">
          Adventures like these can go on forever, and never ever get boring!
          With rando, Alttp will always stay fresh!
