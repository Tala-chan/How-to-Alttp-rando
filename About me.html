        <h1>About this site</h1>
        <p class="rows">
          Greetings traveler! The names Tala, and I'm the creator of this site?
          Why did I make it? For school of course! However, that doesn't mean I
          don't care for the topic. I was given a choise as to what I want to
          make, and this is what I decided on. Because in the end, I love
          emulation and randomizers!
        </p>
        <p class="rows">
          The purpose of this site is to introduce any likeminded individuals to
          this world. The more the merrier, especially if it makes people
          happier!
        </p>
        <p class="rows">
          However, if you're on the fence, allow me to share what made me want
          to get into it in the first place - a youtube channel called
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SpeedGamingChannel">
            SpeedGaming.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p class="rows">
          Every day or so, Speedgaming releases many new speedruns. Some are
          daily rando races, and some are even tournaments! The channel is
          mostly dead, but I was intrigued by the strong sense of passion in the
          videos. Eventually, I even learned to recognise the narrators!
        </p>
        <p class="rows">
          In the end, I wanted to particiapte in it somehow, and am very
          grateful I did. Playing has made my days happier, and I only have
          SpeedGaming to thank for it. If nothing else, I want to give them a
          special thanks for introducing me, and share their content and
          interest with the world!
        </p>
        <p class="rows">
          Are you one of the brave adventurers I'm searching for? Well, I hope
          you feel a sense of companionship in this part of gaming! After all,
          even if it seems like it, none of us are alone!
        </p>
        <p class="rows">
          Thank you for visitiing this site! I hope it gives you something of
          value! :)
